# Introduction
Welcom to LensTell, where dark magic weaves lens data secrets into storiesðŸ”®. 

Provide a lens profile Id in the frontend. Then send the tell request to mumbai network with 0.01 matic to unlock ancient forces .

Wait quietly for a while, then you will recieve what the magic ball tell about the provided id and at the same time you would recieve an NFT which represents the words of the magic ball.

The main idea of the project is storytelling. Stories're powerful, they're universal languages, spreading everywhere and sparking imagination. NFT is a popular approach for artists to create, lens is a hot web3 social network, they're two excellent materials for storytelling. However,for web3 artists,combining the two materials can be challenging, since blockchain data(lens data here) is hard to computed *decentralizly* . I hope LensTell demonstrate how you can compute and consume data from different resources decentralizedly and automatically with Phala, and thus, with the ability to combine data more flexibly, artists have an abundance of materials to unleash their creativity.


# Characters
